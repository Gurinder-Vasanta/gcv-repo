**[NBA Possession Classification with Vision Transformers](https://github.com/Gurinder-Vasanta/vit-research)**:
This project applies the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to predict the outcome of NBA possessions using court broadcast footage from YouTube. The transformer leverages embeddings and temporal/spatial attention to predict the outcomes. 

[Automated Stock Predictor](https://github.com/Gurinder-Vasanta/gcv-repo/tree/Automated_Stock_Price_Predictor): 
This project scraps stock tickers and their corresponding historical spot prices from the business insider website. Each company gets its own .csv file with data and the net.py program uses these csv files and LSTM layers to predict each future price. 

[Modeling the Future Challenge](https://github.com/Gurinder-Vasanta/gcv-repo/tree/Modeling_The_Future_Challenge_Code):
This is the code and the report for the Modeling the Future Challenge in which my I analyzed factors that cause wildfires in California. 

[Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/Gurinder-Vasanta/gcv-repo/tree/Titanic_Survival_Prediction):
This project takes demographic data about passengers in the Titanic. The program takes the demographic data and predicts whether the passenger survived the disaster or not. 

[Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Gurinder-Vasanta/gcv-repo/tree/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis):
This project takes raw string data from 1.6 million tweets and determines if the tweets express a positive emotion, a negative emotion, or a neutral emotion using NLP and one-hot encoding techniques. 

[Handwritten Digit Classification](https://github.com/Gurinder-Vasanta/gcv-repo/tree/Handwritten_Digit_Classification):
This project uses image classification to classify handwritten numerical digits from 0 through 9. 

[Pneumonia XRay Classification](https://github.com/Gurinder-Vasanta/gcv-repo/tree/Pneumonia_XRay_Classification):
This project classifies xray images of lungs that are infected with pneumonia and lungs that are free of pneumonia. There is a test, train, and validation dataset for both kinds of lungs. 

[Optimal Taxi Duration](https://github.com/Gurinder-Vasanta/gcv-repo/tree/Optimal_Taxi_Duration):
This project takes parameters such as latitude and longitude and predicts what the duration of the taxi ride would be in seconds. 

[Google Universal Image Embedding Image Classification](https://github.com/Gurinder-Vasanta/gcv-repo/tree/GUIE_Image_Classification):
This project classifies around 130k pictures into several different categories.
